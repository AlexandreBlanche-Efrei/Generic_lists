# Generic_lists

This code defines two generic structures: a structure ``str_T`` and ``t_T_list``, for a given type ``T``. The types are instanciated at compile time, and their code is written once, in a similar manner to C++ templates.

The ``main`` function defines two variables of generic type ``str_int`` and ``str_string`` respectively, then two linked lists containing ``int`` and ``string`` (``char *``) values respectively.
